Their products include print, home video, broadcast television, films, mobile and online services. ACK receives regular phone inquiries from customers as a response to the toll-free number on their books, magazines, website and advertising. Customers call from over 120 cities, for inquiries ranging from "wow, are you guys really THE Amar Chitra Katha!" to "how can I subscribe to Tinkle?".
