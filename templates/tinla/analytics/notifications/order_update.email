Dear Customers,

Futurebazaar.com, the site, has been inaccessible from couple of days. Apologies to all of you who have not been able to shop or check your order status during this period.

Whatâ€™s happening?

The access to the site has been attacked by unidentified foreign hackers. The hackers have artificially created extremely large volumes of traffic which is blocking out genuine customer traffic. This is a severe attack and a strong security operation is in progress to resume site access to customers asap.  A complaint has also been filed with the Mumbai police unit for cyber-crime.

However the site and all the underlying data and content are however completely secure and not impacted by this attack.  Also all existing orders by customers are secure and are being processed as per committed timelines.
