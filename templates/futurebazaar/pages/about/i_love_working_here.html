I joined FutureBazaar from the Chaupaati Team in October 2010, right before the Battle Campaign. It was a great experience to be part of the team that spearheaded the campaign! 
I learnt a lot about the system, processes and overall the entire way & culture of Future Group.
It has a been a fantastic experience so far and I am thankful to the team here for making this a such a wonderful experience! Truly with such a dedicated team we can surely fulfill our motto, "Udna Hai. Aaj. Abhi!"

The extent of collaboration at Futurebazaar is amazing. Working within a group of very talented, motivated individuals constantly reminds me of why I chose this job - to be challenged to stretch beyond my comfort zone. No day is exactly like the one before, and one thing I truly appreciate is that this job will never be boring. Whatever new challenges I face, I always know that I have access to a large network of willing colleagues ready to lend advice, share knowledge, and help me perform at my best.

Directly after college I was looking for an organization that understood the importance of supporting and investing in their people. When I found out that Futurebazaar had an internal career advising process to help me set and achieve my career goals I was sold. Every day I have the opportunity to work with experienced and talented people across in a working environment that emphasizes teamwork and collaboration.

Culture is the environment that surrounds us at work all of the time, normally Company inducts new Employee to," Pre defined Processes, Guidelines & Decision making Structure". </p>
