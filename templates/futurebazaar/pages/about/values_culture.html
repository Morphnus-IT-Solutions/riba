            <li>
            <strong>We like being simple.</strong> We like simplicity in our ideas. Simple ideas help us accomplish big task with ease and naturalness. For us simple is beautiful. And we believe that by being simple we can drive disproportionate growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed is the essence of everything we do.</strong> We do plan; we do use numbers and date to make informed decisions. But we do not get into exaggerated planning or over-analyze things. We do not like slow down or stop.</li>
            <li><strong>We like to learn while we do.</strong> And to learn, one has to take risks. We may make mistakes in the process. But we do not repeat the same mistakes. We learn from our mistakes.</li>
            <li><strong>We like to believe that customers can teach us everything.</strong> Customers are the reason why we are in the business. We actively watch them and understand their articulated as well as unarticulated needs. We like to offer them products and services even before they express their needs. </li>
            <li><strong>We like to think in the terms of masses.</strong> We do not develop concepts that can only serve the privileged few. We believe in influencing and touching lives on many, many Indians. However we understand the diversity of India and design our offerings to meet local taste and preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>We like building and nurturing relationships.</strong> Learning from the institution of "arranged marriages" where mutually suitable families establish a relationship with one another we treat our partners, vendors and suppliers as "Sambhandi's"! We believe in the win - win - win theory. We believe we can win only if our partners and customers both win!</li>
            <li><strong>We like thrift. We don't like extravagance;</strong> we don't like to flaunt fancy cars and gadgets. We want to lower cost for our customers. We like to be efficient. And we do it by continuously bringing down our own costs of operation.</li>
            <li><strong>We believe in ourselves.</strong> We believe in our organization's ability to think differently and thereby achieve what many others may think impossible. We like to foster a culture of innovation. We like to use both sides of brain -the creative as well as analytical.</li>
            <li><strong>We believe in the power of "people".</strong> People have infinite potential and when people come together to form teams - we force multiply. </li>
            <li><strong>We like taking pride in our core value of Indian-ness.</strong> We believe in emerging as a different region era. We DO NOT benchmark against our nations, but are truly inspired by India - its culture, society and consumers. India will show the world how great things can be achieved differently. And we like to be the thought leaders in driving this change. </li>
            <li><strong>We like to think positively in every situation.</strong> We like to believe that there is always a silver lining even in an adverse scenario. We want to take advantage - listen and learn from the scenario - bad or good. We believe in tomorrow, we believe in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>We do not like to blame others or external factors.</strong> Faced with an adverse scenario, we like to introspect and find out whether the problem is with our organization design, our human dynamics or our systems and processes.</li>
            <li><strong>We work for Growth</strong> - of the society, of employees, of our customers and of our eco system. Growth that we measure in the form of Laxmi (material growth), Saraswati (intellectual growth) and Durga (semiotic and emotional growth).</li>
            <li><strong>We believe in the retail religion.</strong> Customers are our Gods, stores are our temples and work is our workship. </li>

<p class="fb marb30">We Love to rewrite rules, even as we retain our values. </p>

<h2 class="mart20">Culture </h2>
<p>We work in an environment where the deadlines are tighter and the jubilations even more exciting. We like to maintain this energy we've got going on, so we make sure to bring on board exactly the right people. Everyone here has a range of amazing (and often hidden) talents and creative interests.
