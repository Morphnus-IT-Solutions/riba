      <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
  <p class="mart20">We make every effort to fulfill all the orders placed. However, please note that there may be certain orders that we are unable to process and must cancel. The reasons include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product, pricing and stock information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department.</p>
  <p>Our Customer Care Team will communicate to you if all or any portion of your order is cancelled. If your order is cancelled after your credit card has been charged, the said amount will be reversed back in your Card Account.</p>

    <li> Cash payment mode orders will be cancelled for non-receipt of cash within 48 hours from
      the time of placing the order </li>

      the same is not given to us within 48 hours from the time of placing the order </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cancellation by the Customer</h3>
  <p>Please contact our Customer Care in case you wish to cancel the Order. On receipt of the cancellation notice we shall cancel the order and refund the entire amount if the order has not been processed by us. We will not be able to cancel orders that have already been processed or shipped out by us. In some cases this can happen in an hour after you place the order.</p>

In case of payments by Cheque or DD; it may take more time for the Cheque to be delivered to your billing address, and for the funds to be credited to your account after you deposit the Cheque.  In case of EMI transactions, the refund shall happen within 15 working days from the date of refund request.
</p>
  <p>Please note that we shall not be responsible for any delays in credit to the Cardholder's credit card account as that is managed by the Cardholder's issuing bank.</p>
